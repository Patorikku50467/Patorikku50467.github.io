Our first destination is not far away.
<br>
We bike down the long road of Wijndaelerweg until we find an opening.
The opening to the right has a gate which hides 8 grass fields belonging to a popular and surprisingly international football club.
The place is Sportpark Ockenburgh.
<br>
<br>
Now owned by a club, the ground hosts thousands of football loving children every day.
But, what not many people know is that just under 80 years ago, Ockenburgh was a military airfield.
<br>
It was used during the second world war, and it is mostly recognized by historians as the place in which the Battle of Ockenburgh occurred.
Many died in this battle and, as tribute, their names lie carved into the wall of the entrance gate.
<br>
<br>
78 casualties were recorded in the battle which was fought between the Netherlands and Germany.
The dutch trying protect their Queen from the Germans, who flew in to the land through this field.
<br>
Their plan was to land in Ockenburgh, and then follow in a straight line through the laan van medevoort and into the queen's palace, in a hunt for dutch land seizure.
Our next destination will tell you a bit more about this terrifying battle.

Our second destination lies close to our first, and it commemorates the same event.
We head towards the international school of the hague: one of the most prestigious schools of the country, with over 1000 students attending it daily.
	<br>
	<br>
The school lies in Wijndaelerduin, and in the year 2012, it placed a commemorative monument in its entrance.
The sculpture reads “in the service of peace and freedom” and it has two soldiers carved into it.
As mentioned earlier, this sculpture commemorates the battle of ockenburgh, a battle which was triggered by the germans, who came flying into the ockenburgh airfield
	<br>
	<br>
The Germans seemed powerful, but the smart countermeasures of the dutch defied the germans’ plans.
The Dutch started off by closing off the North-Eastern entrance to The Hague, and continued their counter by launching a force of men to fight the Germans that were trying to march down the laan van medevoort. <br>
	<br>
	While these fighted, an other set of dutch troops attacked the airfield in seek of control, and after a successful attack, the Germans were captured by the Dutch, and the few that remained uncaptured ran into the Ockenburgh woods to flee.  
<br>
	There is a plaque on the right of the sculpture which explains all about the battle.
